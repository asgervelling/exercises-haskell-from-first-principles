"The goal for all the following exercises is just to get you playing with
code and forming hypotheses about what it should do. Read the code
carefully, using what we’ve learned so far. Generate a hypothesis
about what you think the code will do. Play with it in the REPL and
ﬁnd out where you were right or wrong."
